DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ttmmuuxx is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  ttmmuuxx
     may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

     When ttmmuuxx is started it creates a new _s_e_s_s_i_o_n with a single _w_i_n_d_o_w and displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the
     screen shows information on the current session and is used to enter interactive commands.

     A session is a single collection of _p_s_e_u_d_o _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s under the management of ttmmuuxx.  Each session has one or more windows linked to it.
     A window occupies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(4)
     manual page documents the technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of ttmmuuxx instances may connect to the same session, and
     any number of windows may be present in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, ttmmuuxx exits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with
     the ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  ttmmuuxx may be reattached using:

           $ tmux attach

     In ttmmuuxx, a session is displayed on screen by a _c_l_i_e_n_t and all sessions are managed by a single _s_e_r_v_e_r.  The server and each client are
     separate processes which communicate through a socket in _/_t_m_p.

     The options are as follows:

     --22            Force ttmmuuxx to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

     --CC            Start in control mode (see the _C_O_N_T_R_O_L _M_O_D_E section).  Given twice (--CCCC) disables echo.

     --cc _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   Execute _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d using the default shell.  If necessary, the ttmmuuxx server will be started to retrieve the
                   ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll option.  This option is for compatibility with sh(1) when ttmmuuxx is used as a login shell.

     --ff _f_i_l_e       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, ttmmuuxx loads the system configuration file from _/_e_t_c_/_t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f, if
                   present, then looks for a user configuration file at _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f.

                   The configuration file is a set of ttmmuuxx commands which are executed in sequence when the server is first started.  ttmmuuxx
                   loads configuration files once when the server process has started.  The ssoouurrccee--ffiillee command may be used to load a file
                   later.

                   ttmmuuxx shows any error messages from commands in configuration files in the first session created, and continues to process
                   the rest of the configuration file.

     --LL _s_o_c_k_e_t_-_n_a_m_e
                   ttmmuuxx stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or _/_t_m_p if it is unset.  The default socket is named
                   _d_e_f_a_u_l_t.  This option allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several independent ttmmuuxx servers to be
                   run.  Unlike --SS a full path is not necessary: the sockets are all created in the same directory.

                   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the ttmmuuxx server process to recreate it (note
                   that this will fail if any parent directories are missing).

     --ll            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as
                   a login shell.

     --SS _s_o_c_k_e_t_-_p_a_t_h
                   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If --SS is specified, the default socket directory is not used and
                   any --LL flag is ignored.

     --uu            Write UTF-8 output to the terminal even if the first environment variable of LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG that is set does
                   not contain "UTF-8" or "UTF8".

     --vv            Request verbose logging.  Log messages will be saved into _t_m_u_x_-_c_l_i_e_n_t_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g and _t_m_u_x_-_s_e_r_v_e_r_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g files in the cur‐
                   rent directory, where _P_I_D is the PID of the server or client process.  If --vv is specified twice, an additional
                   _t_m_u_x_-_o_u_t_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g file is generated with a copy of everything ttmmuuxx writes to the terminal.

                   The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the ttmmuuxx server process to toggle logging between on (as if --vv was given) and off.

     --VV            Report the ttmmuuxx version.

     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_f_l_a_g_s]
                   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control ttmmuuxx, as described in the following sections.  If no commands are
                   specified, the nneeww--sseessssiioonn command is assumed.

     ttmmuuxx may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a
     command key.

     ttmmuuxx supports a large number of commands which can be used to control its behaviour.  Each command is named and can accept zero or more
     flags and arguments.  They may be bound to a key with the bbiinndd--kkeeyy command or run from the shell prompt, a shell script, a configura‐
     tion file or the command prompt.  For example, the same sseett--ooppttiioonn command run from the shell prompt, from _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f and bound to a
     key may look like:

           $ tmux set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

           set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

           bind-key C set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

     Here, the command name is ‘set-option’, ‘--gg’ is a flag and ‘status-style’ and ‘bg=cyan’ are arguments.

     ttmmuuxx distinguishes between command parsing and execution.  In order to execute a command, ttmmuuxx needs it to be split up into its name
     and arguments.  This is command parsing.  If a command is run from the shell, the shell parses it; from inside ttmmuuxx or from a configu‐
     ration file, ttmmuuxx does.  Examples of when ttmmuuxx parses commands are:

           --   in a configuration file;

           --   typed at the command prompt (see ccoommmmaanndd--pprroommpptt);

           --   given to bbiinndd--kkeeyy;

           --   passed as arguments to iiff--sshheellll or ccoonnffiirrmm--bbeeffoorree.

     To execute commands, each client has a ‘command queue’.  A global command queue not attached to any client is used on startup for con‐
     figuration files like _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f.  Parsed commands added to the queue are executed in order.  Some commands, like iiff--sshheellll and
     ccoonnffiirrmm--bbeeffoorree, parse their argument to create a new command which is inserted immediately after themselves.  This means that arguments
     can be parsed twice or more - once when the parent command (such as iiff--sshheellll) is parsed and again when it parses and executes its com‐
     mand.  Commands like iiff--sshheellll, rruunn--sshheellll and ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess stop execution of subsequent commands on the queue until something happens -
     iiff--sshheellll and rruunn--sshheellll until a shell command finishes and ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess until a key is pressed.  For example, the following commands:

           new-session; new-window
           if-shell "true" "split-window"
           kill-session

     Will execute nneeww--sseessssiioonn, nneeww--wwiinnddooww, iiff--sshheellll, the shell command true(1), sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww and kkiillll--sseessssiioonn in that order.

     The _C_O_M_M_A_N_D_S section lists the ttmmuuxx commands and their arguments.

PPAARRSSIINNGG SSYYNNTTAAXX
     This section describes the syntax of commands parsed by ttmmuuxx, for example in a configuration file or at the command prompt.  Note that
     when commands are entered into the shell, they are parsed by the shell - see for example ksh(1) or csh(1).

     Each command is terminated by a newline or a semicolon (;).  Commands separated by semicolons together form a ‘command sequence’ - if a
     command in the sequence encounters an error, no subsequent commands are executed.

     Comments are marked by the unquoted # character - any remaining text after a comment is ignored until the end of the line.

     If the last character of a line is \, the line is joined with the following line (the \ and the newline are completely removed).  This
     is called line continuation and applies both inside and outside quoted strings and in comments, but not inside braces.

     Command arguments may be specified as strings surrounded by single (') quotes, double quotes (") or braces ({}).  This is required when
     the argument contains any special character.  Single and double quoted strings cannot span multiple lines except with line continua‐
     tion.  Braces can span multiple lines.

     Outside of quotes and inside double quotes, these replacements are performed:

           --   Environment variables preceded by $ are replaced with their value from the global environment (see the _G_L_O_B_A_L _A_N_D _S_E_S_S_I_O_N
               _E_N_V_I_R_O_N_M_E_N_T section).

           --   A leading ~ or ~user is expanded to the home directory of the current or specified user.

           --   \uXXXX or \uXXXXXXXX is replaced by the Unicode codepoint corresponding to the given four or eight digit hexadecimal number.

           --   When preceded (escaped) by a \, the following characters are replaced: \e by the escape character; \r by a carriage return;
               \n by a newline; and \t by a tab.

           --   \ooo is replaced by a character of the octal value ooo.  Three octal digits are required, for example \001.  The largest
               valid character is \377.

           --   Any other characters preceded by \ are replaced by themselves (that is, the \ is removed) and are not treated as having any
               special meaning - so for example \; will not mark a command sequence and \$ will not expand an environment variable.

     Braces are similar to single quotes in that the text inside is taken literally without any replacements but this also includes line
     continuation.  Braces can span multiple lines in which case a literal newline is included in the string.  They are designed to avoid
     the need for additional escaping when passing a group of ttmmuuxx or shell commands as an argument (for example to iiff--sshheellll or ppiippee--ppaannee).
     These two examples produce an identical command - note that no escaping is needed when using {}:

           if-shell true {
               display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }$foo'
           }

           if-shell true "\n    display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }\$foo'\n"

     Braces may be enclosed inside braces, for example:

           bind x if-shell "true" {
               if-shell "true" {
                    display "true!"
               }
           }

     Environment variables may be set by using the syntax ‘name=value’, for example ‘HOME=/home/user’.  Variables set during parsing are
     added to the global environment.

     Commands may be parsed conditionally by surrounding them with ‘%if’, ‘%elif’, ‘%else’ and ‘%endif’.  The argument to ‘%if’ and ‘%elif’
     is expanded as a format (see _F_O_R_M_A_T_S) and if it evaluates to false (zero or empty), subsequent text is ignored until the closing
     ‘%elif’, ‘%else’ or ‘%endif’.  For example:

           %if "#{==:#{host},myhost}"
           set -g status-style bg=red
           %elif "#{==:#{host},myotherhost}"
           set -g status-style bg=green
           %else
           set -g status-style bg=blue
           %endif

     Will change the status line to red if running on ‘myhost’, green if running on ‘myotherhost’, or blue if running on another host.  Con‐
     ditionals may be given on one line, for example:

           %if #{==:#{host},myhost} set -g status-style bg=red %endif

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     This section describes the commands supported by ttmmuuxx.  Most commands accept the optional --tt (and sometimes --ss) argument with one of
     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w, or _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e.  These specify the client, session, window or pane which a command should
     affect.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t should be the name of the client, typically the pty(4) file to which the client is connected, for example either of
     _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_p_1 or _t_t_y_p_1 for the client attached to _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_p_1.  If no client is specified, ttmmuuxx attempts to work out the client currently
     in use; if that fails, an error is reported.  Clients may be listed with the lliisstt--cclliieennttss command.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n is tried as, in order:

           1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

           2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the lliisstt--sseessssiioonnss command).

           3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would match a session named ‘mysession’.

           4.   An fnmatch(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.

     If the session name is prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is accepted (so ‘=mysess’ will only match exactly ‘mysess’, not
     ‘mysession’).

     If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches produce an error.  If a session is omitted, the cur‐
     rent session is used if available; if no current session is available, the most recently used is chosen.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w (or _s_r_c_-_w_i_n_d_o_w or _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w) specifies a window in the form _s_e_s_s_i_o_n:_w_i_n_d_o_w.  _s_e_s_s_i_o_n follows the same rules as for
     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n, and _w_i_n_d_o_w is looked for in order as:

           1.   A special token, listed below.

           2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1 in session ‘mysession’.

           3.   A window ID, such as @1.

           4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.

           5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.

           6.   As an fnmatch(3) pattern matched against the window name.

     Like sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty window name specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for ex‐
     ample the nneeww--wwiinnddooww and lliinnkk--wwiinnddooww commands) otherwise the current window in _s_e_s_s_i_o_n is chosen.

     The following special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.  Each has a single-character alternative form.

     TTookkeenn              MMeeaanniinngg
     {start}       ^    The lowest-numbered window
     {end}         $    The highest-numbered window
     {last}        !    The last (previously current) window
     {next}        +    The next window by number
     {previous}    -    The previous window by number

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e (or _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e or _d_s_t_-_p_a_n_e) may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w but with the optional addition of a pe‐
     riod followed by a pane index or pane ID, for example: ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane
     in the specified window is used.  The following special tokens are available for the pane index:

     TTookkeenn                  MMeeaanniinngg
     {last}            !    The last (previously active) pane
     {next}            +    The next pane by number
     {previous}        -    The previous pane by number
     {top}                  The top pane
     {bottom}               The bottom pane
     {left}                 The leftmost pane
     {right}                The rightmost pane
     {top-left}             The top-left pane
     {top-right}            The top-right pane
     {bottom-left}          The bottom-left pane
     {bottom-right}         The bottom-right pane
     {up-of}                The pane above the active pane
     {down-of}              The pane below the active pane
     {left-of}              The pane to the left of the active pane
     {right-of}             The pane to the right of the active pane

     The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:

           select-window -t:+2

     In addition, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n, _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w or _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e may consist entirely of the token ‘{mouse}’ (alternative form ‘=’) to specify
     the session, window or pane where the most recent mouse event occurred (see the _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T section) or ‘{marked}’ (alternative form
     ‘~’) to specify the marked pane (see sseelleecctt--ppaannee --mm).

     Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are prefixed with a ‘$’, windows with a ‘@’, and panes with
     a ‘%’.  These are unique and are unchanged for the life of the session, window or pane in the ttmmuuxx server.  The pane ID is passed to
     the child process of the pane in the TMUX_PANE environment variable.  IDs may be displayed using the ‘session_id’, ‘window_id’, or
     ‘pane_id’ formats (see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section) and the ddiissppllaayy--mmeessssaaggee, lliisstt--sseessssiioonnss, lliisstt--wwiinnddoowwss or lliisstt--ppaanneess commands.

     _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d arguments are sh(1) commands.  This may be a single argument passed to the shell, for example:

           new-window 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Will run:

           /bin/sh -c 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Additionally, the nneeww--wwiinnddooww, nneeww--sseessssiioonn, sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww, rreessppaawwnn--wwiinnddooww and rreessppaawwnn--ppaannee commands allow _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d to be given as
     multiple arguments and executed directly (without ‘sh -c’).  This can avoid issues with shell quoting.  For example:

           $ tmux new-window vi /etc/passwd

     Will run vi(1) directly without invoking the shell.

     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s] refers to a ttmmuuxx command, either passed with the command and arguments separately, for example:

           bind-key F1 set-option status off

     Or passed as a single string argument in _._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f, for example:

           bind-key F1 { set-option status off }

     Example ttmmuuxx commands include:

           refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

           rename-session -tfirst newname

           set-option -wt:0 monitor-activity on

           new-window ; split-window -d

           bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; \
                   display-message "source-file done"

     Or from sh(1):

           $ tmux kill-window -t :1

           $ tmux new-window \; split-window -d

           $ tmux new-session -d 'vi /etc/passwd' \; split-window -d \; attach

CCLLIIEENNTTSS AANNDD SSEESSSSIIOONNSS
     The ttmmuuxx server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients are attached to sessions to interact with them, either when they
     are created with the nneeww--sseessssiioonn command, or later with the aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn command.  Each session has one or more windows _l_i_n_k_e_d into
     it.  Windows may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.  Com‐
     mands for creating, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the _W_I_N_D_O_W_S _A_N_D _P_A_N_E_S section.

     The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

     aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn [--ddEErrxx] [--cc _w_o_r_k_i_n_g_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: aattttaacchh)
             If run from outside ttmmuuxx, create a new client in the current terminal and attach it to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.  If used from inside,
             switch the current client.  If --dd is specified, any other clients attached to the session are detached.  If --xx is given, send
             SIGHUP to the parent process of the client as well as detaching the client, typically causing it to exit.  --rr signifies the
             client is read-only (only keys bound to the ddeettaacchh--cclliieenntt or sswwiittcchh--cclliieenntt commands have any effect)

             If no server is started, aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn will attempt to start it; this will fail unless sessions are created in the configura‐
             tion file.

             The _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n rules for aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn are slightly adjusted: if ttmmuuxx needs to select the most recently used session, it
             will prefer the most recently used _u_n_a_t_t_a_c_h_e_d session.

             --cc will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to _w_o_r_k_i_n_g_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

             If --EE is used, the uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt option will not be applied.

     ddeettaacchh--cclliieenntt [--aaPP] [--EE _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d] [--ss _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t]
                   (alias: ddeettaacchh)
             Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with --tt, or all clients currently attached to the session
             specified by --ss.  The --aa option kills all but the client given with --tt.  If --PP is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of
             the client, typically causing it to exit.  With --EE, run _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d to replace the client.

     hhaass--sseessssiioonn [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: hhaass)
             Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.  If it does exist, exit with 0.

     kkiillll--sseerrvveerr
             Kill the ttmmuuxx server and clients and destroy all sessions.

     kkiillll--sseessssiioonn [--aaCC] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
             Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.
             If --aa is given, all sessions but the specified one is killed.  The --CC flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or silence) in all
             windows linked to the session.

     lliisstt--cclliieennttss [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: llsscc)
             List all clients attached to the server.  For the meaning of the --FF flag, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.  If _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n is speci‐
             fied, list only clients connected to that session.

     lliisstt--ccoommmmaannddss [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t]
                   (alias: llssccmm)
             List the syntax of all commands supported by ttmmuuxx.

     lliisstt--sseessssiioonnss [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t]
                   (alias: llss)
             List all sessions managed by the server.  For the meaning of the --FF flag, see the _F_O_R_M_A_T_S section.

     lloocckk--cclliieenntt [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t]

             Lock _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t, see the lloocckk--sseerrvveerr command.

     lloocckk--sseessssiioonn [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: lloocckkss)
             Lock all clients attached to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.

     nneeww--sseessssiioonn [--AAddDDEEPPXX] [--cc _s_t_a_r_t_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y] [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--nn _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_n_a_m_e] [--ss _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e] [--tt _g_r_o_u_p_-_n_a_m_e] [--xx _w_i_d_t_h] [--yy _h_e_i_g_h_t]
             [_s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
                   (alias: nneeww)
             Create a new session with name _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e.

             The new session is attached to the current terminal unless --dd is given.  _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_n_a_m_e and _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d are the name of and
             shell command to execute in the initial window.  With --dd, the initial size comes from the global ddeeffaauulltt--ssiizzee option; --xx and --yy
             can be used to specify a different size.  ‘-’ uses the size of the current client if any.  If --xx or --yy is given, the
             ddeeffaauulltt--ssiizzee option is set for the session.

             If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special characters are saved and used for new windows in the new session.

             The --AA flag makes nneeww--sseessssiioonn behave like aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn if _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e already exists; in this case, --DD behaves like --dd to
             aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn, and --XX behaves like --xx to aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn.

             If --tt is given, it specifies a sseessssiioonn ggrroouupp.  Sessions in the same group share the same set of windows - new windows are
             linked to all sessions in the group and any windows closed removed from all sessions.  The current and previous window and any
             session options remain independent and any session in a group may be killed without affecting the others.  The _g_r_o_u_p_-_n_a_m_e argu‐
             ment may be:

             1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the new session is added to that group;

             2.      the name of an existing session - the new session is added to the same group as that session, creating a new group if
                     necessary;

             3.      the name for a new group containing only the new session.

             --nn and _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d are invalid if --tt is used.

             The --PP option prints information about the new session after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format
             ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different format may be specified with --FF.

             If --EE is used, the uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt option will not be applied.

             Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given with --tt.  If --SS is specified, only update the
             client's status line.

             The --UU, --DD, --LL --RR, and --cc flags allow the visible portion of a window which is larger than the client to be changed.  --UU moves
             the visible part up by _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t rows and --DD down, --LL left by _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t columns and --RR right.  --cc returns to tracking the
             cursor automatically.  If _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t is omitted, 1 is used.  Note that the visible position is a property of the client not of
             the window, changing the current window in the attached session will reset it.

             --CC sets the width and height of a control client and --FF sets a comma-separated list of flags.  Currently the only flag avail‐
             able is ‘no-output’ to disable receiving pane output.

             --ll requests the clipboard from the client using the xterm(1) escape sequence and stores it in a new paste buffer.

             --LL, --RR, --UU and --DD move the visible portion of the window left, right, up or down by _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t, if the window is larger than
             the client.  --cc resets so that the position follows the cursor.  See the wwiinnddooww--ssiizzee option.

             that contains ‘:’, ‘.’ or ‘%’), in which case the session, window and pane are all changed.  If --ll, --nn or --pp is used, the
             client is moved to the last, next or previous session respectively.  --rr toggles whether a client is read-only (see the

             --TT sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be interpreted from _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e.  This may be used to configure
             multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to sequences of keys.  For example, to make typing ‘abc’ run the lliisstt--kkeeyyss command:

                   bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys

WWIINNDDOOWWSS AANNDD PPAANNEESS
     A ttmmuuxx window may be in one of two modes.  The default permits direct access to the terminal attached to the window.  The other is copy
     mode, which permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to a _p_a_s_t_e _b_u_f_f_e_r for later insertion into another window.  This
     mode is entered with the ccooppyy--mmooddee command, bound to ‘[’ by default.  It is also entered when a command that produces output, such as
     lliisstt--kkeeyyss, is executed from a key binding.

     In copy mode an indicator is displayed in the top-right corner of the pane with the current position and the number of lines in the
     history.

     Commands are sent to copy mode using the --XX flag to the sseenndd--kkeeyyss command.  When a key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of
     two key tables, depending on the mmooddee--kkeeyyss option: ccooppyy--mmooddee for emacs, or ccooppyy--mmooddee--vvii for vi.  Key tables may be viewed with the
     lliisstt--kkeeyyss command.

     The following commands are supported in copy mode:

     Copy commands may take an optional buffer prefix argument which is used to generate the buffer name (the default is ‘buffer’ so buffers
     are named ‘buffer0’, ‘buffer1’ and so on).  Pipe commands take a command argument which is the command to which the copied text is
     piped.  The ‘-and-cancel’ variants of some commands exit copy mode after they have completed (for copy commands) or when the cursor
     reaches the bottom (for scrolling commands).  ‘-no-clear’ variants do not clear the selection.

     The next and previous word keys use space and the ‘-’, ‘_’ and ‘@’ characters as word delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted
     by setting the _w_o_r_d_-_s_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r_s session option.  Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the next
     word and previous word to the start of the previous word.  The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone
     as the word separator.

     The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing ‘f’ followed by ‘/’ will move the cursor to the next ‘/’
     character on the current line.  A ‘;’ will then jump to the next occurrence.

     Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys;
     with emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a number begins prefix entry.

     The synopsis for the ccooppyy--mmooddee command is:

     ccooppyy--mmooddee [--MMeeuu] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
             Enter copy mode.  The --uu option scrolls one page up.  --MM begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
             _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T).  --ee specifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen) should exit copy mode.  While
             in copy mode, pressing a key other than those used for scrolling will disable this behaviour.  This is intended to allow fast
             scrolling through a pane's history, for example with:

                   bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

     Each window displayed by ttmmuuxx may be split into one or more _p_a_n_e_s; each pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate
     terminal.  A window may be split into panes using the sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww command.  Windows may be split horizontally (with the --hh flag) or
     vertically.  Panes may be resized with the rreessiizzee--ppaannee command (bound to ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’ ‘C-Left’ and ‘C-Right’ by default), the cur‐
     rent pane may be changed with the sseelleecctt--ppaannee command and the rroottaattee--wwiinnddooww and sswwaapp--ppaannee commands may be used to swap panes without
     changing their position.  Panes are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are created.

     A number of preset _l_a_y_o_u_t_s are available.  These may be selected with the sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt command or cycled with nneexxtt--llaayyoouutt (bound to
     ‘Space’ by default); once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.

     The following layouts are supported:

     eevveenn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall
             Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

     eevveenn--vveerrttiiccaall
             Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

     mmaaiinn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall
             A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover
             space at the bottom.  Use the _m_a_i_n_-_p_a_n_e_-_h_e_i_g_h_t window option to specify the height of the top pane.

     mmaaiinn--vveerrttiiccaall
             Similar to mmaaiinn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall but the large pane is placed on the left and the others spread from top to bottom along the right.
             See the _m_a_i_n_-_p_a_n_e_-_w_i_d_t_h window option.

     ttiilleedd   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.

     In addition, sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt may be used to apply a previously used layout - the lliisstt--wwiinnddoowwss command displays the layout of each window
     in a form suitable for use with sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt.  For example:

           $ tmux list-windows
           0: ksh [159x48]

           $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}

     ttmmuuxx automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.  Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with
     more panes than that from which the layout was originally defined.

     Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

     bbrreeaakk--ppaannee [--ddPP] [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--nn _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_n_a_m_e] [--ss _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e] [--tt _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w]
                   (alias: bbrreeaakkpp)
             Break _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e off from its containing window to make it the only pane in _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w.  If --dd is given, the new window does not
             become the current window.  The --PP option prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it
             uses the format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be specified with --FF.

     ccaappttuurree--ppaannee [--aaeeppPPqqCCJJ] [--bb _b_u_f_f_e_r_-_n_a_m_e] [--EE _e_n_d_-_l_i_n_e] [--SS _s_t_a_r_t_-_l_i_n_e] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
                   (alias: ccaappttuurreepp)
             Capture the contents of a pane.  If --pp is given, the output goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with --bb or a new
             buffer if omitted.  If --aa is given, the alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.  If no alternate screen
             exists, an error will be returned unless --qq is given.  If --ee is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and back‐
             ground attributes.  --CC also escapes non-printable characters as octal \xxx.  --JJ joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spa‐
             ces at each line's end.  --PP captures only any output that the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet incomplete
             escape sequence.

             --SS and --EE specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the visible pane and negative numbers are
             lines in the history.  ‘-’ to --SS is the start of the history and to --EE the end of the visible pane.  The default is to capture
             only the visible contents of the pane.

             Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a list.  --ZZ zooms the pane.  The following
             keys may be used in client mode:

                   KKeeyy    FFuunnccttiioonn
                   Enter  Choose selected client

                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client name in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and the result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is
             not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used.

             --OO specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘name’, ‘size’, ‘creation’, or ‘activity’.  --ff specifies an initial filter: the
             filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead
             to an empty list, it is ignored.  --FF specifies the format for each item in the list.  --NN starts without the preview.  This com‐
             mand works only if at least one client is attached.

     cchhoooossee--ttrreeee [--GGNNsswwZZ] [--FF _f_o_r_m_a_t] [--ff _f_i_l_t_e_r] [--OO _s_o_r_t_-_o_r_d_e_r] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or pane may be chosen interactively from a list.  --ss starts with sessions
             collapsed and --ww with windows collapsed.  --ZZ zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in tree mode:

                   KKeeyy    FFuunnccttiioonn
                   Enter  Choose selected item

                   O      Change sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a session, window or pane is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the target in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and the result executed as a command.  If
             _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.

             --OO specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘index’, ‘name’, or ‘time’.  --ff specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format
             - if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list,
             it is ignored.  --FF specifies the format for each item in the tree.  --NN starts without the preview.  --GG includes all sessions in
             any session groups in the tree rather than only the first.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess [--bb] [--dd _d_u_r_a_t_i_o_n] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
                   (alias: ddiissppllaayypp)
             Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t.  See the ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess--ccoolloouurr and ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess--aaccttiivvee--ccoolloouurr
             session options.  The indicator is closed when a key is pressed or _d_u_r_a_t_i_o_n milliseconds have passed.  If --dd is not given,
             ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess--ttiimmee is used.  A duration of zero means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.  While the indicator is on
             screen, a pane may be chosen with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys, which will cause _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e to be executed as a command with ‘%%’ substi‐
             tuted by the pane ID.  The default _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is "select-pane -t '%%'".  With --bb, other commands are not blocked from running un‐
             til the indicator is closed.

                   (alias: ffiinnddww)
             Search for a fnmatch(3) pattern or, with --rr, regular expression _m_a_t_c_h_-_s_t_r_i_n_g in window names, titles, and visible content (but
             not history).  The flags control matching behavior: --CC matches only visible window contents, --NN matches only the window name
             and --TT matches only the window title.  The default is --CCNNTT.  --ZZ zooms the pane.

             This command works only if at least one client is attached.

             Like sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww, but instead of splitting _d_s_t_-_p_a_n_e and creating a new pane, split it and move _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e into the space.  This
             can be used to reverse bbrreeaakk--ppaannee.  The --bb option causes _s_r_c_-_p_a_n_e to be joined to left of or above _d_s_t_-_p_a_n_e.

             If --ss is omitted and a marked pane is present (see sseelleecctt--ppaannee --mm), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

             Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing window, it is also destroyed.  The --aa option kills all but the
             pane given with --tt.

             the working directory in which the new window is created.

             When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the rreemmaaiinn--oonn--eexxiitt option to change this behaviour.

             --ee takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment variable for the newly created window; it may be specified multiple
             times.

             The TERM environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’ for all programs running _i_n_s_i_d_e ttmmuuxx.  New windows will auto‐
             matically have ‘TERM=screen’ added to their environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files or by
             the --ee option.

             The --PP option prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format
             ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be specified with --FF.

                   (alias: bbiinndd)
             Bind key _k_e_y to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (without -T), the key is bound in the _p_r_e_f_i_x key table.
             This table is used for keys pressed after the prefix key (for example, by default ‘c’ is bound to nneeww--wwiinnddooww in the _p_r_e_f_i_x ta‐
             ble, so ‘C-b c’ creates a new window).  The _r_o_o_t table is used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to
             nneeww--wwiinnddooww in the _r_o_o_t table (not recommended) means a plain ‘c’ will create a new window.  --nn is an alias for --TT _r_o_o_t.  Keys
             may also be bound in custom key tables and the sswwiittcchh--cclliieenntt --TT command used to switch to them from a key binding.  The --rr flag
             indicates this key may repeat, see the rreeppeeaatt--ttiimmee option.

             To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the lliisstt--kkeeyyss command.

     lliisstt--kkeeyyss [--TT _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e]
                   (alias: llsskk)
             List all key bindings.  Without --TT all key tables are printed.  With --TT only _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e.

     sseenndd--kkeeyyss [--HHllMMRRXX] [--NN _r_e_p_e_a_t_-_c_o_u_n_t] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e] _k_e_y _._._.
                   (alias: sseenndd)
             Send a key or keys to a window.  Each argument _k_e_y is the name of the key (such as ‘C-a’ or ‘NPage’) to send; if the string is
             not recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of characters.  All arguments are sent sequentially from first to last.

             The --ll flag disables key name lookup and processes the keys as literal UTF-8 characters.  The --HH flag expects each key to be a
             hexadecimal number for an ASCII character.

             The --RR flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

             --MM passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see _M_O_U_S_E _S_U_P_P_O_R_T).

             --XX is used to send a command into copy mode - see the _W_I_N_D_O_W_S _A_N_D _P_A_N_E_S section.  --NN specifies a repeat count.

     sseenndd--pprreeffiixx [--22] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
             Send the prefix key, or with --22 the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it was pressed.

     uunnbbiinndd--kkeeyy [--aann] [--TT _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e] _k_e_y
                   (alias: uunnbbiinndd)
             Unbind the command bound to _k_e_y.  --nn and --TT are the same as for bbiinndd--kkeeyy.  If --aa is present, all key bindings are removed.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The appearance and behaviour of ttmmuuxx may be modified by changing the value of various options.  There are four types of option: _s_e_r_v_e_r
     _o_p_t_i_o_n_s, _s_e_s_s_i_o_n _o_p_t_i_o_n_s _w_i_n_d_o_w _o_p_t_i_o_n_s and _p_a_n_e _o_p_t_i_o_n_s.

     The ttmmuuxx server has a set of global options which do not apply to any particular window or session or pane.  These are altered with the
     sseett--ooppttiioonn --ss command, or displayed with the sshhooww--ooppttiioonnss --ss command.

     In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a separate set of global session options.  Ses‐
     sions which do not have a particular option configured inherit the value from the global session options.  Session options are set or
     unset with the sseett--ooppttiioonn command and may be listed with the sshhooww--ooppttiioonnss command.  The available server and session options are listed
     under the sseett--ooppttiioonn command.

     Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window and a set of pane options to each pane.  Pane options inherit from window
     options.  This means any pane option may be set as a window option to apply the option to all panes in the window without the option
     set, for example these commands will set the background colour to red for all panes except pane 0:

           set -w window-style bg=red
           set -pt:.0 window-style bg=blue

     There is also a set of global window options from which any unset window or pane options are inherited.  Window and pane options are
     altered with sseett--ooppttiioonn --ww and --pp commands and displayed with sshhooww--ooppttiioonn --ww and --pp.

     ttmmuuxx also supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.  User options may have any name, so long as they are prefixed with ‘@’,
     and be set to any string.  For example:

           $ tmux setw -q @foo "abc123"
           $ tmux showw -v @foo
           abc123

     Commands which set options are as follows:

     sseett--ooppttiioonn [--aaFFggooppqqssuuww] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e] _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e
                   (alias: sseett)
             Set a pane option with --pp, a window option with --ww, a server option with --ss, otherwise a session option.  If the option is not
             a user option, --ww or --ss may be unnecessary - ttmmuuxx will infer the type from the option name, assuming --ww for pane options.  If
             --gg is given, the global session or window option is set.

             --FF expands formats in the option value.  The --uu flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from the global options
             (or with --gg, restores a global option to the default).

             The --oo flag prevents setting an option that is already s
